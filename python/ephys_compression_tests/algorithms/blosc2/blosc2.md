# Blosc2 Algorithm

Blosc2 is a modern, fast data compression library that builds upon the original Blosc library. It is designed for efficient compression of binary data, particularly optimized for in-memory compression of numerical arrays. Blosc2 uses block-oriented compression with support for multithreading and SIMD instructions.
