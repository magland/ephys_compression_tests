# zlib Algorithm

zlib is a widely-used, general-purpose data compression library that implements the DEFLATE compression algorithm. DEFLATE is a combination of LZ77 (Lempel-Ziv 1977) and Huffman coding. The zlib library is extremely portable, efficient, and free for use in any application.

zlib compression is commonly used in many applications including PNG image compression, HTTP compression, and git repositories. It provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed, making it suitable for a wide range of compression tasks. Python includes zlib as a built-in module, making it readily available without external dependencies.
