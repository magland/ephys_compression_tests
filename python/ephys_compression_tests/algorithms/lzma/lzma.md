# LZMA Algorithm

LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm) is a lossless data compression algorithm that provides a high compression ratio. It is the default and general compression method of 7z format in the 7-Zip program. LZMA uses a dictionary compression scheme and features a high compression ratio with variable dictionary size, while still maintaining fast decompression speed.

The LZMA algorithm is particularly effective for compressing large files and is widely used in various applications including file archivers, software distribution, and embedded systems. Python's built-in `lzma` module provides access to this compression algorithm.
